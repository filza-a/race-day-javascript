There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

<ul>Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.</ul>
<ul>All others receive a number below 1000.</ul>

  
Start time:

<ul>Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.</ul>
<ul>Early adults run at 9:30 am.</ul>
<ul>Late adults run at 11:00 am.</ul>
<ul>Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).</ul>
